say that it’s my pleasure to be here today and participating in the interview; also super appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. My name is Yibo Zhang. I’m a graduate student studying at University of Southern California. I have a Software Engineering Internship at Junlian Automotive Electronics Co Ltd in china, where I was responsible for implementing company employee info API and display the warehouse inbound and outbound table in frontend. I also have another internship at Let’s Level Up company and mainly responsible for designing some **<em>chatting, journal, user profile pages in frontend.</em>  I have some project experiences including a stock search website and a e-commerce high performance order system and a subway retrieval system. I am familiar with many frontend technologies such as Angular, javascript, html, css and some backend technologies like node.js, flask, springBoot. In new chapter for my life, I really want to apply what I learned in school to industry. Although I am not that experienced, I am excited about what I am going to learn through work.</p>
<h3 id="Behavior-Question"><a href="#Behavior-Question" class="headerlink" title="Behavior Question"></a>Behavior Question</h3><h4 id="Tell-me-your-most-challenging-project-x2F-a-time-you-solved-a-complex-problem"><a href="#Tell-me-your-most-challenging-project-x2F-a-time-you-solved-a-complex-problem" class="headerlink" title="Tell me your most challenging project&#x2F; a time you solved a complex problem?"></a>Tell me your most challenging project&#x2F; a time you solved a complex problem?</h4><ul>
<li><p>When I was trying to design a stock search website, I need to implement a feature which simulates people selling and buying stocks, which arises a problem for me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I need to keep track of stocks bought when you need to sell your own stocks since obviously you cannot sell more stocks than your own. But it is not required for me to use some backend databases to keep track of stocks owned for each user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So the problem is that how I can keep track of stocks bought with the help of frontend technologies rather than backend database ?</li>
<li>So I just thought about how to solve this problem by using frontend technologies rather than backend? **  <strong>took a reference on session but I found sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when the page is closed which means it is not appropriate if I want to keep the value stored longer in browser. I asked my friend in industry that how can I use web&#x2F;browser technologies storage functionality without expiration date? My friend told me that I can use localStorage technologies. localStorage technology is kind of similar with sessionStorage but local storage doesn’t have an expired time.</strong> **</li>
<li>The result is that I used localStorage to keep track of numbers of bought stocks and it works after simulating buying and selling stocks.** **</li>
</ul>

<li>推迟了某个customer的request 因为timeline的原因 导致实现这个request比较费时 或者需要重构代码&#x2F;需要重新调整service框架** **</li>
<li>所以把timeline之前做主要目标 然后一些request 放到timeline 之后做？</li>
<li>有更多 更经济的方法来代替这个feature request</li>
<li>实现随机森林算法 保证实现一部分的代码重构（预留一些接口）保证不同算法之间的随机切换-通过达到以后算法的随机切换的目的</li>
<li>我的例子是</li>
<li>S: 做一个员工开发系统，deadline之前我们要做一个数据库 查找员工信息 并且</li>
<li>T：做一个数据库 并且能员工信息排序 但是时间不太够</li>
<li>因此 我们就先实现了基本的增删改查功能，把这个任务放到了后面 并且预留了排序的借口</li>
<li>方便我们重构代码</li>
<li>但是deadline不太合适？因此 我要对这个项目</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; 经历扛住入门级</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; bug deliver results 最重要</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; project** **</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; 做内容 自己负责的内容 任务没完成 具体做的事情</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; spring framework 时间定下来</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; customer 老板</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; internal tool 曾山茶改</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; 时间不太够 first time demo 做不完所有的功能** **</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; 和leader 商量 partial time 咱们要不先做几个feature</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; quality 坚持最高的表征 我们demo的时候只去demo几个</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; sort search** **</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; feedback** **</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; 完成了 sort 最重要 我自己和manager交流 ask some help lead timestamp from** **</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; we schedule the manager the project top -4 to catch the first time demo</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; 剩下的怎么做？ Work time 自己</p>
<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; 实习做什么工作？</p>
<h5 id="Template-I"><a href="#Template-I" class="headerlink" title="Template I"></a>Template I</h5><ul>
<li>the boss asked us to build a company employee’s information management system. I was assigned with writing some methods for search update or delete and sort employee’s information by some of their attributes like name, roles. However the boss just gives us 1 week to accomplish a first demo and I am kind of new to some of the spring framework at that time. I think it is hard for me to accomplish the demo on time.</li>
<li>So the task is to try my best to finish this first demo as sooner as possible.</li>
<li>Then I have some discussion with my manager and we talked about that situation then we both agreed to insist on high standard. So we worked out a solution which is add** **</li>
<li>When I was in my internship, my leader asked us to build a company employee’s info system which can see, delete, update and search employee’s information like name, address, company’s role also can sort employees’ information by some of their attributes like company’s role.** **</li>
<li>However this deadline is very tight for us and it is hard for us to do all of the things before deadline.</li>
<li>As a result, we just implement some of the most important functionalities like search add delete and update employees information. We have kept the interface for sorting employee’s information for easier future implementation.</li>
<li>It turns out we delivered the most important functionalities before deadline and then we handed this question easily.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Template-II"><a href="#Template-II" class="headerlink" title="Template II"></a>Template II</h5><ul>
<li><p>No. I never have to say no to a customer‘s request but I have had to push back to a customer’s request before.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I was in my project building a stock search web page, I was assigned with writing some html pages to show the stock’s basic information like IPO date, company’s website. Also I need to build a stock price daily variation chart with highchart. The team leader assigned me with three days based on someone which already had experiences related to that and I am kind of new to render chart.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I finished rending chart for almost 1 day, I found that there is a problem: this website takes a long time to fully render the daily chart. I feel it may take 1 or 2 days to debug this problem, which means I may not solve that problem on time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>So the task for me is try to solve this problem and deliver the result as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>So I have some discussions with team leader about my situation at that time. firstly, My leader suggested me to ignore that rendering chart problems and continue on displaying basic stock information. I think this solution is not that great since we need to insist on highest standard. Then my leader suggest me that we can prioritize the most important features and focus on displaying basic stock information first before deadline and after finish that demo trying to solve rendering daily chart question as soon as possible. He also gave me some website links to use highcharts in html.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then I try to displaying basic stock information first and we delivered that demo before deadline. For solving rendering daily chart problem, I tried to look for some official document and examples to learn highcharts and ask my teammates some questions to understand our backend node.js file. I found that the problem lies in some unnecessary API calls in backend. After reducing API calls in backend we finally get daily chart rendered quicker 1 day later.** **</p>
</li>
<li><p>As a result, we delivered the first demo before deadline and after delivering the second demo, the teammates gives me positive feedbacks. I learn that it is essential to keep learning new knowledge and optimizing the project with better qualities. Besides, I found that a good schedule with priorities also counts.</p>

<p>但是刚开始设计搭建framework的队友在搭建过程中遇到了困难</p>
<p>他花了很久也没有能够处理</p>
<p>此时我就和manager商量接手了这项工作，重新分配了workload 并且然她负责因此大概完成的前端代码的编写，别的容易上手的问题</p>
<p>最后我们圆满完成了任务。。（如何量化？）</p>
<ul>
<li>我们一起做一个员工开发系统 我队友安装spring framewok 的时候出现了问题</li>
<li>此时我主动担起了安装Spring框架的责任 并且责任还不在我的身上 此时</li>
<li>In my previous internship, our team was asked to design a company employee’s information management system. my responsibility mainly lies in building web page and the employee’s information table. However, one of my colleagues tell me that he has some problem with installation of spring framework. It took him a very long period of time but he still cannot install it.</li>
<li>So the task for me is trying to help my colleague and deliver the demo before deadline.</li>
<li>In order to handle this situation, I have some discussions with team manager and told him I can help him with some spring framework related works. The manager agrees with my suggestion and he rearranged the workload for me and my colleague. The manager suggests my colleague to work on my frontend work and I also leave some document for my colleague to get started easier. Then I was asked to work on write spring framework solution like building employee’s API.** **</li>
<li>As a result, both of us finished that subtask and we delivered that demo before deadline. I receive a lot of thanks from my colleague and I also receive some feedback from my manager. I feel it is essential to help** **</li>
<li>In this situation I have some discussion with tech leader and told him that I can done something related with spring framework and** **</li>
<li>最后我们及时完成了任务</li>

<p>用hibernate mybatis spring data 更简单</p>
<ul>
<li>In my previous internship, I was in charge of using Hibernate as a ORM framework to persist employee data to MySQL database. After finishing this task, I received some positive feedbacks from others.</li>
<li>However, I continue to think about how to improve this task.** **</li>
<li>I started to learn some other ORM frameworks like MyBatis and JPA and Spring Data to thought if I could use one of this ORM to replace Hibernate to achieve a better performance. After looking for some official documents for introducing MyBatis and Spring Data and searching comparison about each ORM in stackoverflow or GitHub repo.** **</li>
<li>I tried to use Spring Data JPA since it is integrated in Spring framework and it is easier to implement and config since spring data jpa makes it easy to implement JPA based repositories without the need to write some HQL code.</li>
<li>Further improvements make my code more concise and I received more positive feedbacks from my colleagues.</li>

<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; 说服同事去做什么事情</p>
<ul>
<li>In one of my previous project our team tried to build a CRM project to display company employee’s information in a company.** **</li>
<li>Some of my teammates want to use Spring as the framework but I think SpringBoot could be a good fit to this project.</li>
<li>I took this situation seriously and expressed that we need to decide which one to use sooner because we both don’t want waste time. After that, we have some discussions and I convinced them of why using springboot in two reasons. The first reason is that springboot is easier to get started because it greatly reduces the time for configuration. The second reason is that it is not that hard for them to learn springboot with the understanding of spring.</li>
<li>In this way, we make a decision very early and decide to use springboot as a framework to this project. We finished the project by deadline and I received positive feedbacks from teammates and teammates disagreeing with me before.</li>

<li>In one of my previous project our team tried to build a CRM project to display company’s employee information and I was responsible for role restriction which is giving different role in a company different access to this system. However, I do not have any previous knowledge on how to do this and I also have a very tight deadline as well.** **</li>
<li>So the task for me is to implement role restriction in a very short period of time.</li>
<li>I have some discussions with my team leader and he told me he doesn’t know what technology can be used to solve this problem.** **</li>
<li>In this project different actions in frontend means different http request in backend. It is very intuitive to think about that we can check the role when http request comes in and we don’t give them access if the role is not match.**  **So I start to look for stack overflow and google doc on role based authorization for http request and I found that I can use spring security. Spring Security in the web tier (for UIs and HTTP back ends) is based on Servlet Filters. I tried to use spring security to “filter” different request URLs. I give the admin role in this system to delete company employee’s information right by giving them the access to request “employees&#x2F;delete” url in backend. ** **</li>
<li>As a result, we handed this problem based on learning spring security before the deadline. I received special thanks from my teammates as they appreciate what I was done.</li>

<li>In one of my previous project of designing a stock search website, our team leader assigned me with writing an html page which shows some basic information of every searched stock also with charts displaying variations of stock prices in each day &#x2F; week &#x2F; month.** **</li>
<li>The original time estimate was based on someone already had experiences related to that, however I am totally new to use charts in html and I knew that I was not able to complete this task on time.** **</li>
<li>I have some discussions with team leader and she said she understand my circumstances. We worked out a solution which is trying to focus on the main functionality of this website before the deadline: showing basic information of every search stock and display only variation of stock prices today since we feel that these two features are the most important ones then we can leave the variations in each week or month for a later update. Several days later, I finally complete all tasks they gave me and got a high overall rating for my work.** **</li>
<li>I feel so lucky to be part of the team and very appreciate the open-communication culture that could always have me to move in the right direction and prioritize the tasks in a right order.</li>

<li>The original time estimate was based on someone already had experiences related to that, however I am totally new to use charts in html so there is definitely a tight deadline for me to accomplish this task.** **</li>
<li>I have some discussions with team leader about that situation and asked her how I can get things started sooner. We worked out a solution which is trying to focus on the main functionality of this website first: showing basic information of every search stock and display only variation of stock prices today since we feel that these two features are the most important ones. Also the team leader suggested me to use highchart to display variations in each day&#x2F;week&#x2F;month&#x2F;year. I then look up some official documents about highchart and demos to get things familiar.** **</li>
<li>I finally complete all tasks before deadline and teammates gave me positive feedback s regarding my work. I am very appreciate the open-communication culture that could always have me to move in the right direction and prioritize the tasks in a right order and I also learned how to familiarize skills sooner.</li>

<li>In my previous internship, I was in charge of sorting company employee’s information based on one of there attributes like name, role, ascending and descending etc.</li>
<li>So the task for me is to write a sorting method for company employee’s information.</li>
<li>It is intuitive to think up with a solution which is just writing sorting algorithm for each attributes like name, role. I don’t think this is a great method since you need to write a lot of methods for a lot of attributes. This method will take a long time. In this way, I thought could I do something easier and simpler. Our company uses spring data spa as our ORM framework. Then I tried to look up some official document for spring data rest.I use Spring Data’s method derivation, whereby the query is generated from the method name and signature. Only I need to do is just write method name and signature in an interface without the need to fully implementing it.</li>
<li>As a result, I use spring data spa to solve my sorting issues. Spring data spa greatly reduces me from writing a lot of code and checking bugs for what I have written. I achieve my request before deadline and I received positive feedbacks from my colleagues.</li>
